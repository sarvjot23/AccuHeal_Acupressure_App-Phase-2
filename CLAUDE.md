## Project Memories

* Whenever a new acupressure point is added to/removed from the app, make sure to update the file 'F:\ai_projects\projects\accuheal\docs\ACUPRESSURE_POINTS_INVENTORY.md' accordingly. You can reference that file without having to go through the codebase to know that these are the current points in the app.

* When you're planning to add an acupressure point, make sure that the code is not present already in the database. We want to avoid duplicate points added.
