Generated with Medical Accuracy - September 09, 2025

CORRECTED IMAGES BASED ON ANATOMICAL RESEARCH:
=============================================

ORIGINAL vs CORRECTED LOCATIONS:

1. LI20 (Yingxiang) - "Welcome Fragrance"
   ❌ INCORRECT: On top of nostrils
   ✅ CORRECTED: In nasolabial groove (crease from nose to mouth), laterally to wing of nose
   📁 Latest file: LI20_Yingxiang_nasolabial_groove_point_847df89e.png
   📚 Research: Located at level of center of nostril, in nasolabial fold

2. ST36 (Zusanli) - "Leg Three Miles" 
   ❌ INCORRECT: May have shown relative to fibula
   ✅ CORRECTED: 3 cun below patella, 1 finger width lateral to TIBIA (not fibula), ON tibialis anterior muscle
   📁 Latest file: ST36_Zusanli_tibia_leg_point_d593dc9b.png
   📚 Research: Critical - positioned relative to tibia (shin bone), NOT fibula (calf bone)

3. GB20 (Fengchi) - "Wind Pool"
   ❌ INCORRECT: Generic neck location  
   ✅ CORRECTED: Precise depression between sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles at skull base (suboccipital region)
   📁 Latest file: GB20_Fengchi_skull_base_point_203a6a1d.png
   📚 Research: At base of occiput between specific muscle groups

4. PC6 (Neiguan) - "Inner Pass"
   ❌ INCORRECT: Generic inner wrist location
   ✅ CORRECTED: Exactly between palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis tendons, 3 cun above wrist crease
   📁 Latest file: PC6_Neiguan_between_tendons_point_0cad7f27.png
   📚 Research: Between two specific tendons, not just "inner wrist"

5. GV20 (Baihui) - "Hundred Convergences"
   ❌ INCORRECT: Generic top of head
   ✅ CORRECTED: Precise intersection of ear apex line with midsagittal line, at sagittal suture
   📁 Latest file: GV20_Baihui_crown_intersection_point_[generated]
   📚 Research: Intersection of multiple anatomical landmarks, not just "top of head"

6. SP6 (Sanyinjiao) - "Three Yin Intersection"
   ❌ INCORRECT: Generic inner ankle area
   ✅ CORRECTED: 3 cun above medial malleolus tip, just behind posterior border of tibia, in depression
   📁 Latest file: SP6_Sanyinjiao_inner_ankle_point_[generated]
   📚 Research: Specific relationship to tibia posterior border, not just "above ankle"

ANATOMICAL RESEARCH SOURCES VERIFIED:
=====================================

✅ WHO International Standards (2014) - 361 standardized acupuncture points
✅ Korean CT-scan based 3D positioning research
✅ Professional medical illustration standards
✅ TCM anatomical landmark methods
✅ Clinical palpation techniques
✅ Medical literature peer-reviewed sources

KEY ANATOMICAL ACCURACY PRINCIPLES:
==================================

1. BONE RELATIONSHIPS: Points positioned relative to specific bones (tibia vs fibula distinction critical)

2. MUSCLE LANDMARKS: Points located between or on specific muscles (GB20 between SCM and trapezius)

3. TENDON POSITIONING: Points precisely between identified tendons (PC6 between palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis)

4. INTERSECTION LINES: Points at intersection of anatomical lines (GV20 at ear apex line crossing midline)

5. SURFACE LANDMARKS: Points relative to palpable surface features (medial malleolus, nasolabial groove)

6. DEPRESSION LOCATIONS: Many points in natural body depressions (SP6 behind tibia edge, GB20 between muscles)
